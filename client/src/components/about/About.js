              <p>  JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, 
                    is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.
                    JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
                    It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, 
                    and first-class functions.
              </p>
